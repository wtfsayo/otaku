import { createAgent } from '@elizaos/core';

const agent = createAgent({
  plugins: [morphoPlugin],
  // ... other configuration
});
```

### Natural Language Commands

The plugin understands various natural language commands. **Important**: Always specify the token symbol (USDC, WETH, DAI) with amounts for clarity.

#### Market Structure
In Morpho Blue markets like "WETH/USDC":
- **Loan Token** (USDC): Used for supply/borrow operations to earn yield or take loans
- **Collateral Token** (WETH): Used for collateral operations to secure borrowing positions

#### Token Operation Mapping
- **Supply/Borrow/Withdraw/Repay**: Uses the loan token (e.g., USDC in WETH/USDC)
- **Supply Collateral/Withdraw Collateral**: Uses the collateral token (e.g., WETH in WETH/USDC)

#### Examples by Operation Type

#### Supply Assets (Lend to Earn Yield)
- "Supply 1000 USDC to WETH/USDC market"
- "Lend 0.5 USDC to WETH/USDC for yield"
- "Supply 500 DAI to DAI/WETH market"

#### Supply Collateral  
- "Provide 0.5 WETH as collateral in WETH/USDC"
- "Supply 1 WETH collateral for WETH/USDC market"
- "Add 2 WETH as collateral in WETH/DAI"

#### Borrow Assets
- "Borrow 500 USDC from WETH/USDC market"
- "Take a loan of 200 USDC against WETH"
- "Borrow 1000 DAI from DAI/WETH market"

#### Withdraw Assets (Remove Supplied Funds)
- "Withdraw 300 USDC from WETH/USDC market"
- "Remove 100 USDC from my supply position"
- "Withdraw 500 DAI from DAI/WETH"

#### Withdraw Collateral
- "Remove 0.1 WETH collateral from WETH/USDC"
- "Withdraw 0.5 WETH collateral from WETH/DAI"
- "Remove WETH collateral from market"

#### Repay Loans
- "Repay 200 USDC in WETH/USDC market"
- "Pay back all USDC debt in WETH/USDC"
- "Repay 500 DAI loan in DAI/WETH"

#### Vault Operations
- "Deposit 1000 USDC into the Morpho USDC vault"
- "Withdraw 500 USDC from my vault position"
- "I want to add 0.5 WETH to the vault"
- "Remove all my shares from the USDC vault"

#### Bundled Operations
- "Supply 1 WETH and borrow 2000 USDC in one transaction"
- "I want to supply collateral and take a loan atomically"
- "Bundle supply and borrow to save gas"

#### Rewards
- "Claim my Morpho rewards"
- "I want to harvest my MORPHO tokens"
- "Check and claim all my available rewards"

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Gas Settings
```
"Supply 1000 USDC with max 300000 gas for matching"
"Borrow 0.5 WETH using 400000 gas for better rates"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Supply with Optimal Matching

```typescript
// User: "Supply 5000 USDC to WETH/USDC market to earn yield"
// Agent response:
"üè¶ I'll supply 5000 USDC to the WETH/USDC market for optimized yields through peer-to-peer matching.

üìä Transaction Details:
- Market: WETH/USDC (supplying USDC - the loan token)
- Transaction Hash: 0xabc...123
- Amount Supplied: 5000 USDC
- P2P Matched: 3500 USDC (70%)
- Pool Deposited: 1500 USDC

üí∞ Rate Improvement:
- Your APY: 4.5%
- Pool APY: 3.0%
- Improvement: +50%"
```

### Example 2: Efficient Borrowing

```typescript
// User: "Borrow 1000 USDC from WETH/USDC market"
// Agent response:
"üí∏ I'll borrow 1000 USDC from the WETH/USDC market with optimized rates through peer-to-peer matching.

üìä Transaction Details:
- Market: WETH/USDC (borrowing USDC - the loan token)
- Amount Borrowed: 1000 USDC
- P2P Matched: 600 USDC (60%)
- Your Rate: 3.2%
- Pool Rate: 4.5%
- Rate Savings: 1.3%"
```

### Example 3: Collateral Management

```typescript
// User: "Provide 2 WETH as collateral in WETH/USDC market"
// Agent response:
"üîê I'll provide 2 WETH as collateral to the WETH/USDC market.

üìä Transaction Details:
- Market: WETH/USDC (collateralizing WETH - the collateral token)
- Amount: 2 WETH
- Health Factor: 2.8 (Safe)
- Max Borrowable: ~4,800 USDC"
```

## Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Insufficient collateral
- P2P matching failures
- Liquidity constraints
- Network issues
- Invalid parameters

Each error includes helpful suggestions for resolution.

## Gas Optimization

The plugin automatically optimizes gas usage for P2P matching:

1. Estimates required gas based on market conditions
2. Adjusts gas limits for network congestion
3. Analyzes cost-benefit of matching operations
4. Provides recommendations for optimal gas allocation

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Health Factor**: Keep health factor above 1.5 for safety
2. **Optimize Timing**: Execute transactions during high matching periods
3. **Adjust Amounts**: Match common liquidity sizes for better P2P matching
4. **Gas Management**: Use recommended gas limits for optimal results
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Check position efficiency periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Matching Efficiency**
   - Try different transaction amounts
   - Execute during peak activity periods
   - Increase gas allocation for matching

2. **High Gas Costs**
   - Reduce matching gas limit for smaller positions
   - Bundle operations when possible
   - Monitor network congestion

3. **Rate Not Improving**
   - Check current market conditions
   - Verify P2P liquidity availability
   - Consider different assets
