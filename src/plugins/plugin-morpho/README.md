## Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Insufficient collateral
- P2P matching failures
- Liquidity constraints
- Network issues
- Invalid parameters

Each error includes helpful suggestions for resolution.

## Gas Optimization

The plugin automatically optimizes gas usage for P2P matching:

1. Estimates required gas based on market conditions
2. Adjusts gas limits for network congestion
3. Analyzes cost-benefit of matching operations
4. Provides recommendations for optimal gas allocation

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Health Factor**: Keep health factor above 1.5 for safety
2. **Optimize Timing**: Execute transactions during high matching periods
3. **Adjust Amounts**: Match common liquidity sizes for better P2P matching
4. **Gas Management**: Use recommended gas limits for optimal results
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Check position efficiency periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Matching Efficiency**
   - Try different transaction amounts
   - Execute during peak activity periods
   - Increase gas allocation for matching

2. **High Gas Costs**
   - Reduce matching gas limit for smaller positions
   - Bundle operations when possible
   - Monitor network congestion

3. **Rate Not Improving**
   - Check current market conditions
   - Verify P2P liquidity availability
   - Consider different assets

## Development
