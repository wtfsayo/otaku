## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have Bun installed
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd wise
bun install
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required for core functionality
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

# Coinbase CDP (Developer Platform) - Required for CDP wallet operations
COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME=your-cdp-api-key-name
COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-cdp-private-key
COINBASE_WALLET_SECRET=your-wallet-secret-hex-string  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32

# Optional: AI Model APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key

# Optional: Platform Integrations  
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
TWITTER_API_KEY=your-twitter-api-key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token

# Optional: Advanced Features
MORPHO_API_KEY=your-morpho-api-key
CLANKER_API_URL=https://api.clanker.com
```

### Setting Up Coinbase CDP Wallet

The `COINBASE_WALLET_SECRET` is **required** for creating and managing wallets through the Coinbase Developer Platform. This secret is used for multi-party computation (MPC) key management.

**Generate a secure wallet secret:**
```bash
# Using OpenSSL (recommended)
openssl rand -hex 32

# Or using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the generated hex string and add it to your `.env` file:
```bash
COINBASE_WALLET_SECRET=<your_generated_hex_string>
```

**Important Notes:**
- The wallet secret must be a hex-encoded string (64+ characters)
- Keep this secret secure - it's used for wallet authentication
- Do NOT commit this secret to version control
- Coinbase CDP uses MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for enhanced security

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the agent in development mode
bun run dev

# Or start in production mode
bun run start
